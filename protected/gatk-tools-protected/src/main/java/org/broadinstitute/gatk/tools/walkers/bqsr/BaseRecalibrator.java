/**
 * Detect systematic errors in base quality scores
 *
 * <p>
 * Variant calling algorithms rely heavily on the quality scores assigned to the individual base calls in each sequence
 * read. These scores are per-base estimates of error emitted by the sequencing machines. Unfortunately the scores
 * produced by the machines are subject to various sources of systematic technical error, leading to over- or
 * under-estimated base quality scores in the data. Base quality score recalibration (BQSR) is a process in which we
 * apply machine learning to model these errors empirically and adjust the quality scores accordingly. This allows us
 * to get more accurate base qualities, which in turn improves the accuracy of our variant calls.
 *
 * The base recalibration process involves two key steps: first the program builds a model of covariation based on the
 * data and a set of known variants (which you can bootstrap if there is none available for your organism), then it
 * adjusts the base quality scores in the data based on the model.
 *
 * There is an optional but highly recommended step that involves building a second model and generating before/after
 * plots to visualize the effects of the recalibration process. This is useful for quality control purposes.
 *
 * This tool performs the first step described above: it builds the model of covariation and produces the recalibration
 * table. It operates only at sites that are not in dbSNP; we assume that all reference mismatches we see are therefore
 * errors and indicative of poor base quality. This tool generates tables based on various user-specified covariates
 * (such as read group, reported quality score, cycle, and context). Assuming we are working with a large amount of data,
 * we can then calculate an empirical probability of error given the particular covariates seen at this site,
 * where p(error) = num mismatches / num observations.
 *
 * The output file is a table (of the several covariate values, number of observations, number of mismatches, empirical
 * quality score).
 * </p>
 *
 * <h3>Inputs</h3>
 * <p>
 * A BAM file containing data that needs to be recalibrated.
 * <p>
 * A database of known polymorphic sites to mask out.
 * </p>
 *
 * <h3>Output</h3>
 * <p>A GATKReport file with many tables:</p>
 * <ul>
 *     <li>The list of arguments</li>
 *     <li>The quantized qualities table</li>
 *     <li>The recalibration table by read group</li>
 *     <li>The recalibration table by quality score</li>
 *     <li>The recalibration table for all the optional covariates</li>
 * </ul>
 *<p>
 * The GATKReport table format is intended to be easy to read by both humans and computer languages (especially R).
 * Check out the documentation of the GATKReport (in the FAQs) to learn how to manipulate this table.
 * </p>
 *
 * <h3>Usage example</h3>
 * <pre>
 * java -jar GenomeAnalysisTK.jar \
 *   -T BaseRecalibrator \
 *   -R reference.fasta \
 *   -I my_reads.bam \
 *   -knownSites latest_dbsnp.vcf \
 *   -o recal_data.table
 * </pre>
 *
 * <h3>Notes</h3>
 * <ul><li>This *base* recalibration process should not be confused with *variant* recalibration, which is a s
 * ophisticated filtering technique applied on the variant callset produced in a later step of the analysis workflow.</li>
 * <li>ReadGroupCovariate and QualityScoreCovariate are required covariates and will be added regardless of whether
 * or not they were specified.</li></ul>
