/**
 * Combine per-sample gVCF files produced by HaplotypeCaller into a multi-sample gVCF file
 *
 * <p>
 * CombineGVCFs is meant to be used for hierarchical merging of gVCFs that will eventually be input into GenotypeGVCFs.
 * One would use this tool when needing to genotype too large a number of individual gVCFs; instead of passing them
 * all in to GenotypeGVCFs, one would first use CombineGVCFs on smaller batches of samples and then pass these combined
 * gVCFs to GenotypeGVCFs.</p>
 *
 * <h3>Input</h3>
 * <p>
 * Two or more Haplotype Caller gVCFs to combine.
 * </p>
 *
 * <h3>Output</h3>
 * <p>
 * A combined multisample gVCF.
 * </p>
 *
 * <h3>Usage example</h3>
 * <pre>
 * java -jar GenomeAnalysisTK.jar \
 *   -T CombineGVCFs \
 *   -R reference.fasta \
 *   --variant sample1.g.vcf \
 *   --variant sample2.g.vcf \
 *   -o cohort.g.vcf
 * </pre>
 *
 * <h3>Caveat</h3>
 * <p>Only gVCF files produced by HaplotypeCaller (or CombineGVCFs) can be used as input for this tool. Some other
 * programs produce files that they call gVCFs but those lack some important information (accurate genotype likelihoods
 * for every position) that GenotypeGVCFs requires for its operation.</p>
