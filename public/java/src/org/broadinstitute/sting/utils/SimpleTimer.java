/**
 * A useful simple system for timing code with nano second resolution
 *
 * Note that this code is not thread-safe.  If you have a single timer
 * being started and stopped by multiple threads you will need to protect the
 * calls to avoid meaningless results of having multiple starts and stops
 * called sequentially.
 *
 * This timer has been modified to provide better semantics for dealing with
 * system-level checkpoint and restarting. Such events can cause the internal JVM
 * clock to be reset, breaking timings based upon it. Whilst this is difficult to
 * counter without getting explicit notice of checkpoint events, we try to moderate
 * the symptoms through tracking the offset between the system clock and the JVM clock.
 * If this offset grows drastically (greater than CLOCK_DRIFT), we infer a JVM restart
 * and reset the timer.
