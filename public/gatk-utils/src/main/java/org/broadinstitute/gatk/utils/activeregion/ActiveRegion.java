/**
 * Represents a single active region created by the Active Region Traversal for processing
 *
 * An active region is a single contiguous span of bases on the genome that should be operated
 * on as a single unit for the active region traversal.  The action may contains a list of
 * reads that overlap the region (may because there may be no reads in the region).  The region
 * is tagged as being either active or inactive, depending on the probabilities provided by
 * the isActiveProb results from the ART walker.  Each region carries with it the
 * exact span of the region (bases which are the core of the isActiveProbs from the walker) as
 * well as an extended size, that includes the ART walker's extension size.  Reads in the region
 * provided by ART include all reads overlapping the extended span, not the raw span.
